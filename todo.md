- [ ] Add Constraints to WidgetOptions instead of displacement ?
- [ ] Change how menu work so that any widgets can be put in it.
- [ ] Improve text edition by adding a cursor and allowing displacement in the text with key arrows
- [ ] When formatting text, separates it by line and draw each lines individually
